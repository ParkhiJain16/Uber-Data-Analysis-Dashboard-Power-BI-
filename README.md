# ðŸš– Uber Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes Uber ride data using **Power BI** to uncover key trends and patterns in customer behavior and ride demand.  
The goal is to provide **data-driven insights** for better decision-making.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removed duplicate records and standardized date-time formats.

Handled missing values by replacing unknowns with "Unknown" or appropriate defaults.

Converted categorical fields (e.g., Vehicle Type, Payment Method) into clean, consistent labels.

Ensured numerical fields (e.g., Booking Value, Ride Distance, Ratings) were correctly typed.

Final dataset: 61,601 rows Ã— 21 columns ready for analysis in Power BI.
